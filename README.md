# CUNYFirst Bot - Make sure you get the classes you want

Classes fill up pretty quickly on CUNYFirst. This simple web driver is the equivalent of someone clicking refresh on the CUNYfirst student center every 1-10 minutes and then registering you when they see that a class is open. Just put the classes you want in your shopping cart, and the driver will register you as soon as it finds an opening!

You have to have Mozilla installed, set up python and run $pip install selenium, but that's pretty much it.
